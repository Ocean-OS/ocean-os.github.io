# ocean-os.github.io
This is just sort of a repository of repositories for things I am/have been working on in the past year on here. 
## MC (Mine.craft)
A currently-in-progress Javascript Minecraft clone, built off of MineKhan 0.3 by Willard21 on Github. I never plan to monetize this, and it is just a simple project for me. The source for this is under the Creative Commons License CC BY-NC-SA 4.0. 
## SM64
An archived version of a Javascript Super Mario 64 port. Not made by me; credits are in the site. 
## virus
Not an actual virus, this just opens up a lot of tabs.
## ide
An IDE I'm working on.
## mc-assets
This is the location at which files are fetched for the (currently in alpha testing) Mine.craft launcher. The contents of this folder are under the Creative Commons License CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.
